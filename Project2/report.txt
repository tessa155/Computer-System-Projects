- Performance
The major measurement metric of performance of the server program is stability in connection with clients.
The number of successfull connections with clients is taken into consideration to calculate this measurment.
Each column in the tables below is the average of 10 experiments.


1) server on digitalis

client number                   5           10          15          20

successfull connection(%)       100%        100%        100%        100%


2) server on NeCTAR VM

client number                   5           10          15          20

successfull connection(%)       100%        100%        100%        100%


Conclusion:
Regardless of the host where the server program runs on, 
it is able to make connection with concurrent clients successfully judging from the outcome of
this performance metric (always 100%).
Therefore, stability of the server program is very reliable in terms of concurrent connection.




- Resource Usage
In order to investigate resource usage, four major measurement metrics are chosen which are the total amount of time
spent executing in either user mode or kernel mode, the total virtual memory size and resident set size.
Each column in the tables below is the average of 5 experiments.


1) Time in user mode (millisecond)

client number                       5               10              15              20

time in user mode(digitalis)        0               1.2             2.2             1.5

time in user mode(NeCTAR VM)        20.2            16.3            28.7            40.4



2) Time in kernel mode (millisecond)

client number                       5               10              15              20

time in kernel mode(digitalis)      6.3             24.6            15.6            22.9

time in kernel mode(NeCTAR VM)      16.5            48.2            56.9            64.7


Conclusion: 
Generally, the server requires more execution time in kernel mode than in user mode since it includes 
a lot of system calls to accomplish its tasks. 
One of the interesting points is that VM takes much more execution time in comparision to digitalis both in 
user mode and in kernel mode. This could be caused by the fact that digitalis is better host than this VM instance
in terms of cpu performance and resources.  



3) Total virtual memory size (kB)

client number             5              10             15              20
 
VmSize(digitalis)         389864.5       768764.9       1157908.8       1198884.2

VmSize(NeCTAR VM)         375196.7       612784.8       653764.5        694744.1	


4) Total resident set size (kB)

client number             5             10               15              20

VmRSS(digitalis)          836.7         1683.3           1030.4          1059.2

VmRSS(NeCTAR VM)          1090.6        1050.1           3072.7          5132.9


Conclusion: 
Obviously, as the number of concurrent clients increases, total virtual and resident set size also increases.
However, there is a distinct difference between digitalis and VM in terms of how much the total virtual 
memory rises.

The total virtual memory size of digitalis is ascending quite sharply whereas that of NeCTAR VM does not change much.
This could be because the whole virtual memory of the VM is reasonably smaller than digitalis so that it could not 
assign big portion of virtual memory to just one process.

In respect of resident set size, generally, VM uses more RSS. Digitalis is a big host used by many users 
so it should divide and assign its RAM to that many users and that is the reason why the sever is assigned 
less RSS on digitalis than NeCTAR VM.
